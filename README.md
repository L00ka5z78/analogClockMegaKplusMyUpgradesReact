Analogue clock application. Wrote on MegaK JS course as a digital one. Rebuilt to analogue.
With help of some tutorials and notes. 

Pros:
  1. Works well.
  2. Looks good.
  
Cons:
  1. I couldnt write it 100% on my own, had to get some help others.
  2. I'm not fully understand some things/processes which are going on. 
  3. Github pages, doesn't show the app. Had to do sth wrong during deployment process.
  
 App is not done. Features i want to add in teh future:
  * dark/light mode switch
  * buttons redirecting to views with different time zones.
